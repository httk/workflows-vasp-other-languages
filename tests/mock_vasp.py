"""A mock VASP, so the packages run on a machine that has no VASP.

**This is not VASP and computes nothing.** It reads the POSCAR in its working
directory and writes the files a finished VASP run leaves behind — OUTCAR,
OSZICAR, CONTCAR, and ``vasprun.xml`` — with numbers that are plausible enough for
the parsers of the workflows-vasp runners and meaningless as physics. The "relaxed"
structure is the input with its last atom nudged.

Use it exactly the way a deployment names the real thing:

.. code-block:: console

    httk workspace settings set --key vasp.command --value "$PWD/tests/mock_vasp.py" default
    httk workflow run

``HTTK_MOCK_VASP_FAIL_ONCE=1`` makes the first run in a directory fail with a
diagnosable ``ZPOTRF`` error instead, which is what makes the runners' remedy
ladder visible: the job applies one reviewed remedy and the rerun succeeds.
